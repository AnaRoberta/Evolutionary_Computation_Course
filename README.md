# Evolutionary_Computation_Course

1)Modelling and Random Search 
2)Representation and Variation Operators/ 
3)Selection 
**Uniform (same probability to all solutions) 
**Truncate (only the solutions with best fitness) 
**Tournament (winners of tournaments between groups of solutions) 
**Roulette (selection probability proportional to fitness) 
**Stochastic Uniform Selection (stochastic probability proportional to fitness) 
**Overselection (80% of operations on the x% best solutions) 
**Round-Robin Tournament (each individual evaluated against other q individuals) 
4)Scaling 
**Window 
**Sigma 
**Linear rank
**Exponential rank 
**No scaling 
5)Population Management and Multi-Modal Problems
